        Green tea is part of my daily routine because it brings both clarity and calm. Its taste is simple and
        grounding, a clear contrast to the strong effect of coffee. Instead of a quick surge of energy, it offers steady
        focus, which makes it useful during an afternoon break. The antioxidants it contains support health, but the
        value goes beyond nutrition. Drinking it slowly creates space to pause and pay attention to the present moment.
        For me, green tea is less a beverage than a steady practice of care and balance.
